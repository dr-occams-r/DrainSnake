As per the comments in the code:

// Drain Snake
//   TPU Flexible to make sure it doesn't break down drain
//   Many small hooks
//   Thicker body to keep it's shape when printing in TPU
//   Body much thicker than hooks to ensure that hooks
//     would break before body if ever stuck on a hook
//     down the drain
//   Easy to print
//   Handle Hook to hang and dry
//   Handle Ring to pull

// Print Notes:
//   TPU
//   0.4mm Nozzle, 0.2mm Height, First Layer Width 0.5mm
//   Infill 100%
//   Lines: 3 Perimeter
